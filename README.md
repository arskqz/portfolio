# Portfolio
My portfolio made with Tailwind 3.4.17 / JavaScript.

### Notes for future as of 30.9.2025

* Im doing these changes for improving the site. duh.

* I think moving forward or maybe if I find some magic motivation. I'll update to Tailwind 4. This would obiusly cause many issues.

* --> Future plan do these small changes in tailwind 3 and js.

* --> Update to Tailwind 4 and react/ typescript?? once I need or want to do bigger changes...
